### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Juan, after 4 years being active as a warehouse worker i wanted to change my life. In my last year I started with a course "programming and ICT" where i learned the basics of coding in python and databases. after completing this course I officialy quitted my job and started a new full time course "programming" at Hogeschool PXL. In this course im learning C#, javascript, HTML, CSS and SQL.
